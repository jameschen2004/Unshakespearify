Extras done: 4
- Store your translations in a file named pirate.dat 
The file should have lines in the form â€œword:translation."

- Handle upper and lower case and/or punctuation

- Have an option to translate different languages.

- Try to tackle more advanced translations like converting parts of
words rather than straight substitutions or inserting pirate phrases
at appropriate points in your document.
